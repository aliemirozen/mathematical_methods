# **Mathematical Methods**

## Methods:
- Bisection Method
- Secant Method
- Golden Section Search

## How Does It Work?
The 'function' function first prints seven different functions defined in it as output and you are asked to choose one of these functions. When the function is selected, Bisection Method, Secant Method and Golden Section Search methods are found respectively and printed as output.

## Bisection
In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. 

## Secant Method
In numerical analysis, the secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f.

## Golden Section Search
The golden-section search is a technique for finding an extremum (minimum or maximum) of a function inside a specified interval. For a strictly unimodal function with an extremum inside the interval, it will find that extremum, while for an interval containing multiple extrema (possibly including the interval boundaries), it will converge to one of them. If the only extremum on the interval is on a boundary of the interval, it will converge to that boundary point. The method operates by successively narrowing the range of values on the specified interval, which makes it relatively slow, but very robust.
